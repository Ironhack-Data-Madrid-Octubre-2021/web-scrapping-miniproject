# Web-scrapping miniproject

## Context

You've been recently hired by a new company as **data analyst**. Your boss has asked you to get data from a competitors website and analyze it.

He wants you to get the most relevant data and extract some insights from it.

## TODO's

1. Decide which web you are going to scrape.
2. Decide which information seems relevant for you and scrape it.
3. Clean the data.
4. Visualize at least 5 insights and export the graphs.

## Deliverables
- Jupyter notebook with the scraped data.
- Exported visualization data.
- Create a markdown file (like the readme) with a brief report including at least 5 graphs summarizing your conclusions. Use markdown format and include the exported graphs as images.
